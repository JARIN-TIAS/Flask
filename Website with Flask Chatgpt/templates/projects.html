        <h3 style="color: black;">Project 1: Real Time License Plate Detection and Recognition with OCR using Yolov8</h3>
        <p>
            I developed a real-time license plate detection and recognition system using YOLOv8 for object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction. This project aims to enhance automated vehicle identification for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and security enforcement.
